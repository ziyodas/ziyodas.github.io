        <h1><i>Homely Homecrest</i></h1>
    </div>

    <div class="essay">
        <p>I grew up in Homecrest for 8 years and I greatly appreciate the experience...</p>
        <p>I loved the Avenue U vibrant and lively 99 cent stores, the Chinese markets that had a pungent odor of tuna when you walked into the store, the nearby Rite Aid that had almost everything you could ask for. I loved walking around the suburban blocks in my neighborhood and seeing couples that had grown old together and were walking with their arms interlocked on their morning walks to the piers, with pieces of bread in their hands hoping to feed the white swans at the pier. I remember the first time I started walking home by myself during 5th grade after weeks of begging my mom. It was a learning experience. I had come to realize how ignorant I had been of my surroundings while I had been reliant on my sisters and mom whilst walking home from P.S. 206. I had never really observed (and I mean really observed) the Grand Car Wash across my school and all of their passionate and devoted employees that were almost always laughing and joking around, the pharmacy right next to my school that almost always had kids after school storming inside it and getting 50 cent steaming hot ramen, and the new bright blue “modern” and “advanced” apartment building that was being constructed that looked so desperately out of place and uneasy in the midst of brown 1920s style apartment buildings in a neighborhood that I was once familiar with.</p>
        <p>This building was being built right in the middle of my everyday 5 minute path from school to my house and my house to school. This meant I had to witness its progress every day and especially for even longer than I wanted to, when I faced a stop light across the street from it. This slowly became the thing I resented. Then, I started to resent my everyday walk altogether. I felt so much anger towards this building and for those who would come every day and work on crafting it and I didn’t know why. Every day, I would notice a brand new feature about it, if it was a flier hung up saying to call the number to be able to apply or if there would be half of a see-through floor done. Maybe, it was because of its fancy, standoffish modernness of it all and its expensive exteriors that screamed “Hey, look at me. I am richer than you. Richer than all of you.” Maybe, that was why. Maybe, it was the feeling of knowing my immigrant parents never being able to afford living in this luxurious apartment. Looking back at it, it wasn’t really luxurious. But it was the most luxurious thing my 12 year old eyes had ever laid her eyes on.</p>
        <p>I didn’t know how to overcome these feelings of jealousy and resentment that I had for this building and even my neighborhood for letting this big, blue building sneak in and demand itself to be looked at and yearned for. I hated the fact that this dumb building had tainted my view of my cherished neighborhood altogether. This building was not doing justice to the rich culture that my sweet and calm neighborhood already had. It was taking away from the coziness of the nearest family-run sushi place that was so small but always lively, it was taking away from the comfort that people felt when entering the deli that knew the regulars’ names by heart, it was taking away from the safety and affection people felt walking into the Homecrest library and being met with the most warmest smiles that the elderly library employees could offer. I realized that this building was trying to manufacture a fake sense of my neighborhood and a fake sense of New York City and it was not doing it well. Its phoniness and artificiality was deeply felt and grieved in the neighborhood.  This happens constantly and rapidly in the ever-changing city of New York; the big elites always trying to implement new construction projects and improvements in neighborhoods that never had space for them in the first place.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing a fake sense of New York City never does justice and instead takes away from the already abundant rich culture and homeliness the neighborhood has. Over time, I had learned to appreciate and be comfortable with the beauty and richness that my neighborhood already had in its humble and simplistic details. And I did this by not giving the attention that the demanding building craved for, anymore. Through this, I began to realize I started to resent the bright blue building less and less. My resentment decreased as I became comfortable with my own neighborhood, and my definition of my neighborhood did not include this building.</p>
